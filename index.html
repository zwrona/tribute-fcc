            To start a serious conversation about computers, Greiman had to expose their potential. The perfect opportunity arose when she was invited to design and edit an issue of Design Quarterly (No. 133) in 1986. Technically, her issue did not resemble a magazine at all. It was, instead, a 3-foot tall fold-out poster. Using MacVision, the designer generated an image of her naked body and a variety of graphic symbols, all under the title, “Does It Make Sense?” For many it did not, but the first step toward the digital transformation of graphic design had been taken.
